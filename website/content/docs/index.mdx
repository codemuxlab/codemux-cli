# Welcome to CodeMux

CodeMux is a specialized terminal multiplexer designed for **"vibe coding"** - a development approach where LLMs are the primary driver of code generation rather than direct typing.

## What makes CodeMux different?

Unlike generic terminal multiplexers, CodeMux is purpose-built for AI-assisted development:

- **üéØ Smart Prompts**: Detects and intercepts interactive prompts to provide native web UI components
- **üåê Rich Interfaces**: Provides web UIs instead of raw terminal emulation  
- **üöÄ Claude Code Ready**: Optimized integration with Claude Code for seamless AI development
- **üì± Cross Platform**: Works on desktop, web browsers, with mobile support in development

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew install codemuxlab/tap/codemux
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codemuxlab/codemux-cli
cd codemux-cli
cargo build --release
```

## Quick Start

### Quick Mode
Launch a single AI session immediately:

```bash
# Start Claude
codemux claude

# Continue from previous session
codemux claude --continue

# Open with web interface
codemux claude --open
```

### Server Mode
Run as a background service managing multiple sessions:

```bash
# Start the server
codemux server start

# Add a project
codemux add-project /path/to/project

# List active sessions
codemux list

# Attach to a session
codemux attach <session-id>
```

## Key Features

### Session Management
- Multiple concurrent AI sessions
- Project-based organization
- Session persistence and reconnection
- Automatic session recovery with `--continue` flag

### Web Interface
- Real-time terminal emulation with VT100 parser
- Native HTML components for prompts
- Git integration with diff viewer
- Project and session management UI

### Cross-Platform Support
- macOS (Intel & ARM) 
- Linux (x64 & ARM64)
- Web browsers via integrated web UI
- Mobile support in development (React Native app available)
